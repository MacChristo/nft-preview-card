## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned how to use the Flexbox and many other styling tags like the opacity tag.

### Continued development

I still intend to learn more about the Flexbox.

### Useful resources

-   [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius) - This helped me when I wanted to make the edges of my shape a bit curved. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
-   [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hsl.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand HSL color codes. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
-   I'd like to recommend the MDN site or w3schools for anybody involved in programming. They are really great.
